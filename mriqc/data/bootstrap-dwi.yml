# Reports bootstrap file
# ======================
# This is a YAML-formatted file specifying how the NiReports assembler
# will search for "reportlets" and compose them into a report file,
# typically in HTML format.

    caption: This panel shows a mosaic of the brain. This mosaic is the most suitable to
      screen head-motion intensity inhomogeneities, global/local noise, signal leakage
      (for example, from the eyeballs and across the phase-encoding axis), etc.
    subtitle: Voxel-wise average across volumes in this <em>DWI shell</em>,
      zoomed-in covering just the brain
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: zoomedstd}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic of the brain. This mosaic is the most suitable to
      screen within-volume head-motion (e.g., missing slices) and reconstruction ghosts
      such as those intrinsic to SMS parallelization.
    subtitle: Voxel-wise standard deviation calculated across volumes in this <em>DWI shell</em>,
      zoomed-in covering just the brain
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: background}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic enhancing the background around the head.
      Artifacts usually unveil themselves in the air surrounding the head, where no signal
      sources are present.

      Thanks for using <em>MRIQC</em>. The following information may assist in
      reconstructing the provenance of the corresponding derivatives.
